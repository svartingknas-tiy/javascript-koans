    at .<anonymous> (file:///Users/svartingknas/Pro/javascript-koans/koans/AboutArrays.js:50:31)
Array Slice was difficult to understand.
expect(array.slice(0, 2)).toEqual(["peanut', 'butter"]);
why wouldnt it be peanut, and?
Arrays = Do not understand what the second number in the splice really represents.

About Functions
Did not understand functioning of "should use lexical scoping to synthesise functions",

About Mutability

about higherOrderFunctions.
Using map, does not begin at 0;
  it("should use 'reduce' to update the same result on each iteration", function () {

when the message is not specified, does it become true or false?

expect(simpleCircle.describe()).toBe("This circle has a radius of: 10");
expect(colouredCircle.describe()).toBe('This circle has a radius of: 5');

dont understand why the value doesnt pass on, instead, has to be manually put in.

About inheritance
I dont understand the functioning of the constructors.
